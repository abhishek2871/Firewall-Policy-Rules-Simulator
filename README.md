# Firewall-Policy-Rules-Simulator
Firewall Policy Simulator is a Python Tkinter application that lets users create, save, and load firewall rules, and simulate packets to see if they are allowed, denied, or dropped. It supports TCP/UDP, wildcards, and JSON storage, providing a hands-on tool for learning network security and traffic filtering.
